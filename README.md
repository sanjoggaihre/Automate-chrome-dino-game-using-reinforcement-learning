In this project, the agent operates within the environment of the Chrome Dino AI game. The agent receives rewards for successfully navigating each frame without crashing. However, if the game ends in a crash, a significant penalty is imposed. The agent is trained using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) model, allowing it to learn optimal strategies for avoiding obstacles and maximizing its performance in the game.
